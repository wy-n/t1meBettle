This project's provide a full command-line bug tracker software.


                                   Why ?

I made this project because I often (always) work with SSH on a lightweight
server with no-X. And I want a huge software quality, so a bugtracker can't
be skipped.

I know that there is some programs which provides a command line interface for a
web-based bugtracker (like MantisBT or Bugzilla). But what if I don't want to
host a Bugtracker ? What if want to use my bug tracker on a local computer with
no internet connection ? What if I want to enclose all the story of a project
inside the project, and not enclose all the bugs of all my projects inside one
bugtracker ?

And after all, why not ?

                                 Development

Here is a list of available goals of the Make command :
- all      => Build all the software and put the classes in the classes/ folder
- clean    => Remove all the classes of the classes/ folder
- run      => Run the software. Note that to pass arguments to the software you
              have to use the syntax : make ARGS="<arg>" run
- command  => Ask for a command's name and create the class file which
              corresponds to the new command (and also update the Makefile)
